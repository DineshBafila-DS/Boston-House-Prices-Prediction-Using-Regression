# Boston-House-Prices-Prediction-Using-Regression
## Boston Housing-Problem Description
* Predict the price of a house
* We will use Boston House price dataset for this purpose

## Dataset Description
* The boston House Price dataset consist prices of houses of the Boston city
* The Dataset consist of 506 datapoints
* 14 columns (13- Features and 1 Target(Price))
* All the column of this dataset have continuous value.
* **Some of the features or columns in the dataset are shown in the below table:**


| **Key Feature Title** | Description |
|-----------------------|-------------|

## Machine Learning Model, Optimization and Cost Function used: ##
* Here **Linear Regression (Supervised Machine Learning)** Algorithm has been used to predict the prices of the houses of Boston city.
* Optimization is performed using **Gradient Descent Algorithm**.
* To measure the cost of this model, the **Mean Squared Error** cost function has been used here.
